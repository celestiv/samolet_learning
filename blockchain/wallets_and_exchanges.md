# Crypto wallets

The main task of crypto wallets is to store a secret key that provides access to your assets. There are two types of wallets: cold and hot.

### CryptoWallet
Cold wallets are divided into hardware and paper wallets. A hardware wallet looks like a USB flash drive with several buttons, and is most often equipped with a display. Like any other wallet, it stores your private keys, which can be obtained after entering a pre-set password. A paper wallet is one or more private keys on paper, which can be represented as a text string or as a QR code.

Hot wallets have a direct connection to the Web. This group includes all web wallets and most software wallets.

## Crypto exchanges
Crypto exchange is a trading platform that allows users to buy, sell, store and exchange cryptocurrencies. The principle of operation of such projects is similar to the currency, commodity and stock exchanges — cryptocurrency prices are determined on the basis of the «supply / demand» principle. The operation of cryptocurrency exchanges also can be compared with a traditional market: it has a buyer and a seller

> There are several types of cryptocurrency exchanges:
- Centralized Cryptocurrency Exchanges (CEX). You can trade cryptocurrency and fiat money (ordinary government money) at the same time. Works on the principle of a public or private bank.
- Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchanges (DEX). There are no managers on decentralized crypto exchanges. The process of buying, selling or exchanging cryptocurrency is fully automated here and is conducted on the basis of smart contracts and Automated Market Makers (AMM), which provide more attractive exchange offers. Due to decentralization, the assets of DEX clients are more secure than the financial assets of users of CEX.
- Crypto exchangers with cryptocurrency storage. These exchangers are not intermediaries between the buyer and the seller, they trade directly with customers. Crypto exchangers charge a commission for their work.
- Cryptocurrency exchanges without cryptocurrency storages. After the end of the transaction, these exchangers transfer funds to the client's account or to a bank card. It is the fastest way to purchase cryptocurrency without going through the registration and verification procedure. Most often, such services have relatively high commissions and an unfavorable exchange rate.

Many cryptocurrency exchanges require you to verify your identity to increase the limit on transactions. This partially deprives the user of anonymity, but sometimes it is simply impossible to implement the exchange of assets, or receive bonuses without verification. It is a standard procedure for transaction legality confirmation.

The method of replenishing an exchange account is extremely simple, it is enough to transfer currency from your wallet to the address indicated by the exchange, or replenish the account with fiat money, and then exchange it for cryptocurrency.

The currency on the exchanges has a liquidity indicator. The higher it is, the more currency can be bought or sold at a time, and the more stable its price will be.

> Currency liquidity depends on several factors
- The popularity of decentralized applications tied to a specific currency or token.
- Trading volume — the total volume of all cryptocurrency trading deals. The more people are interested in making a currency exchange, the greater the market volume and liquidity.
- Ease of use — the liquidity of a currency increases if it is frequently used as a means of payment.

## Automated market maker

AMM, or Automated market maker — a computer program that provides currency liquidity. Such systems help to find favorable conditions for financial transactions quickly. Thanks to full automation, the process is unbiased, focusing only on math calculations. AMM is directly linked to liquidity pools.

## Liquidity pools

A liquidity pool is a vault in which market participants put their assets together in order to provide a pool of liquidity for everyone who wishes to exchange this asset. In the traditional financial system, such pools are represented by large banks that manage the funds of a large number of depositors and can even «print» additional money.

Liquidity mining is a way of organizing the market in which the exchange and token issuer reward the community for providing liquidity to the certain trading pairs. Miners, or liquidity providers, receive income as a share of the commission that traders or investors of a decentralized platform pay for an exchange.

Also, liquidity mining is one of the most reliable ways to save funds: when the rate of one of the tokens falls, the ratio of the number of tokens in relation to each other will change, and converting it to the fiat currency, you will lose much less than if you simply keep it on your wallet. On top of that, you will also earn commissions from other users' transactions.
