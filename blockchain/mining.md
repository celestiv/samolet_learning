# What is mining?

Mining is the activity of creating new structures, most often using computing power (video cards, special processors and boards), or by providing storage space (hard drives and solid state drives).

Miners maintain blockchain systems and receive a reward for this in the form of commission fees from blockchain users, or in the form of new units of cryptocurrency (this is how emission often occurs).Miners constantly compete with each other for a reward. The competition rules may change in different blockchains, depending on the proof algorithm. There are 2 most popular mining algorithms: Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake.

## Proof-of-Work
Blockchains using the PoW (Proof-of-work) algorithm require miners to calculate a specific hash. Their computers try to find the values ​​of the «Nonce» parameter (random number), until it is possible to get a hash, the numerical value of which is less than the specified one. The set value determines the complexity, so the smaller it is, the more difficult it is to calculate a hash that will satisfy the condition. The miner who was the first to pick this parameter forms a block and receives a reward. Thus, in blockchains with Proof-of-Work, there is a constant race of capacities, because the more capacities you have, the faster you count the Nonce parameters, and the more chances you have to be the first to pick a hash that satisfies the condition.

Due to the growing competition, miners are constantly strengthening the equipment base. New participants also want to grab their piece, while the speed of finding a block always remains the same, since it is necessary to maintain a steady emission. Emission is performed by providing miners with a reward. Complexity of finding a block is dynamic and changes depending on the capacity of the entire network. This ensures the stability of mining. As a consequence, this type of mining requires huge resources. In some well-known cryptocurrencies using PoW, the energy spent on one transaction is enough to power a family of several people for a week. At the same time, the security of the blockchain is increasing, because a 51% attack becomes almost impossible (only from the side of large mining pools, to which we will return in this lesson).

## Proof-of-Stake
There is no power race in Proof-of-Stake, where the chance to find a block is distributed depending on the number of coins in the user's account. That is, the larger the balance of a node (node — a miner's computer connected to the blockchain network), the higher its chance of finding a block and receiving a reward, while the computer hardware requirements are minimal.

The 51% attack is prevented here by very high costs for its implementation, since the attacker will have to invest a lot of money in this blockchain in order for him to have the right to extract the block, and several times in a row. Moreover, the attacked cryptocurrency will drastically lose its value, and the attacker will lose a lot of money.

There is also a danger of accumulating large funds within one mining pool, which, with a certain amount of capital, may begin to dictate its own rules.

## Proof-of-Storage
Proof-of-Storage algorithm miners are rewarded in proportion to the amount of memory they allocate on their storage devices. The difficulty of mining does not increase and takes less than a second. This method of mining is considered to be the most reasonable and environmentally friendly; energy is spent only for transfer and store information. Due to the potentially low system requirements, it becomes possible to deploy unused old devices.

## Mining pools
The total power of all miners' devices in the world is very high, therefore the probability of finding a block and receiving a reward becomes almost zero if you act alone. To receive the reward steadily, miners form mining pools, uniting their resources. The reward is distributed in proportion to the capacity provided.

## Pool
Many mining pools have grown over time and become so large that they may become a threat within their blockchains. Generation of 3 blocks in a row by one pool is now considered a normal story. Many pools understand that they are already too large, and deliberately restrict entry for new miners so as not to discredit themselves in the eyes of the crypto community.

## Cloud mining
Some companies are mining on an industrial scale, placing large mining machines in places with cheap electricity and preferably not too hot climate. They can lease out part of their resources, forming the so-called «cloud mining». Scammers often use the name of «cloud mining». They actually do not mine anything, but only draw numbers to tenants on their own website.

## Hidden mining
Some miners use illegal ways to obtain currency and install malicious programs on other users' devices that mine currency and transfer it to an attacker. This type of scam is called hidden mining.
