# Tokens

Token — unit of value comparable to traditional securities. You can obtain, sell or buy it on special exchanges. Unlike coins, tokens do not have to be launched on their own blockchain, while coins always have their own blockchain. There are four main types of tokens: utility, security, credit and NFT (non-fungible).

- Utility tokens are digital currencies that are used internally in a product and provide access to its services. They help projects to provide funding for future development.

- Security tokens are similar to company shares, with their help you can receive interest payments, base assets and dividends. Such tokens are more liquid and provide access to distributed ledger services.

- Credit tokens are used for short-term borrowing with further payment of the interest rate on the loan amount.

- NFTs are completely unique and cannot be counterfeited or splitted. Various types of assets can become an NFT: documents, works of art, audio tracks, elements of computer games, sculptures, and so on.

## Smart contracts

A smart contract is a computer program that monitors and enforces obligations. Participants of a smart contract determine the terms of the transaction and sanctions for their failure, and certify it with digital signatures. The smart contract independently determines the execution of every condition and decides whether to complete the transaction and issue the required asset (money, shares, real estate), or to impose a penalty on the participants. A smart contract can also be compared to a vending machine, into which you throw money, press a button, and if all the conditions are met, it gives you a can of soda.

Due to smart contracts users do not need to involve a third party to certify transactions. This significantly speeds up the process, reduces costs and eliminates human error risk.

## ICO

ICO (Initial Coin Offerings) — the issue of tokens, which in the future can be used to pay for any services of the company. We can say that in this way people provide financing for the enterprise, and in return in the future they will be able to receive bonuses, discounts and other privileges for this. It is an excellent opportunity for users to support an attractive project, provide themselves with additional bonuses from the company, or resell these tokens for a higher price.

However, you need to be very careful when participating in ICOs. Sometimes this method is used by scammers to get money from users.

> Frequent marks of a scam are:
- The absence of any development besides the coin
- The lack of news about the development
- The absence of a roadmap
- New accounts in social networks
- A high percentage of tokens that remain with the development team by the conditions of the emission.
